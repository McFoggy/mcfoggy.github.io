Bye-bye blogger !!! I am now on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

As I am working on windows, I installed without any issues [Portable Jekyll](https://github.com/madhur/PortableJekyll). Having that in my toolset I successfully migrated the Blogger posts to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) by just following instruction on the very good Jekyll import [documentation page](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/).
