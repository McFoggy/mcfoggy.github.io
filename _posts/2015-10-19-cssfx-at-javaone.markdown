We are now one week before JavaOne starts... I am a bit exited about this edition! 

I am exited even if I'll not be there: but part of my work will be.

Jonathan Giles will present an in-depth usage of ScenicView inside a [BOF](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&search=BOF2665) and doing so he will show the CSSFX part I have contributed to the project to enable hot reloading of CSS inside JavaFX application.

I hope there will be positive feedback after the session.
